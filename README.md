# LESS Compile-on-save

Compile LESS stylesheets on save.

Based on [atom-compile-less](https://atom.io/packages/atom-compile-less) by
[freshl](https://atom.io/users/freshl).

- Uses LESS v2.x
- Can generate source maps
- Can exclude LESS files based on a regular expression. By default files beginning
    with and underscore will not be auto-compiled.
